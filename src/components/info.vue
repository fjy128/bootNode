     <div class="blog-title"><h1>Introducing Printable Award Certificates</h1></div>
     <p>In the recent years loads of designers, developers and digital agencies have been requesting Award Certificates to print for their office walls. I’m stoked to announce they are finally here!</p>
     <p>Traditional certificate designs are bland but I wanted something fresh, colorful and eye-catching (on the wall). After seeing recent illustration work by fellow South African <a href="https://dribbble.com/jasondevilliers" target="_blank">Jason De Villiers</a>, I knew he’d be the guy to help with a unique art direction.</p>
     <p>I’m super stoked with the outcome and also announced it on Dribbble as the debut One Page Love shot (update: no longer using Dribbble).</p>
     <p>Another added touch we’re looking into is foil stamping the gold star or printing it as a glossy sticker to layer on top of the print. We just need to experiment a bit more there on what works best. </p>
